The AWS Multi-ENI Controller has been deployed to your cluster.

To create a NodeENI resource, create a YAML file with the following content:

apiVersion: networking.k8s.aws/v1alpha1
kind: NodeENI
metadata:
  name: example-eni
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    ng: multi-eni  # Replace with your node selector
  subnetID: subnet-xxxxxxxx  # Replace with your subnet ID
  # OR use subnetName: your-subnet-name
  # OR use multiple subnets:
  # subnetIDs:
  # - subnet-xxxxxxxx
  # - subnet-yyyyyyyy
  securityGroupIDs:
  - sg-xxxxxxxx  # Replace with your security group ID
  # OR use securityGroupNames:
  # - your-security-group-name
  deviceIndex: 2
  deleteOnTermination: true
  description: "Example ENI"

Then apply it with:

  kubectl apply -f your-file.yaml

To check the status of your NodeENI resource:

  kubectl get nodeeni
