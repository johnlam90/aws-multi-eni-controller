# AWS Multi-ENI Controller Performance Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive performance testing strategy for the AWS Multi-ENI Controller to validate its behavior at enterprise scale (10 nodes × 10 ENIs = 100 total ENIs).

## Testing Objectives

1. **Scalability Validation**: Ensure the controller can handle 100+ ENIs across 10+ nodes
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure ENI creation/attachment times, reconciliation performance
3. **Resource Utilization**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage under load
4. **AWS API Efficiency**: Validate rate limiting, retry behavior, and circuit breaker functionality
5. **Cleanup Performance**: Test resource cleanup efficiency during scale-down scenarios

## Key Performance Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **ENI Creation Time**: Time from NodeENI creation to ENI available in AWS
- **ENI Attachment Time**: Time from ENI creation to successful attachment to node
- **Reconciliation Loop Duration**: Time for complete reconciliation cycle
- **Concurrent Operations**: Number of parallel ENI operations
- **AWS API Call Rate**: Requests per second to AWS APIs
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed operations

### Resource Metrics
- **Controller CPU Usage**: CPU utilization of the controller pod
- **Controller Memory Usage**: Memory consumption and growth patterns
- **ENI Manager CPU/Memory**: Resource usage of DaemonSet pods
- **Network Throughput**: Data transfer rates during operations

### AWS API Metrics
- **API Call Latency**: Response times for EC2 API calls
- **Throttling Events**: Number of AWS API throttling occurrences
- **Circuit Breaker State**: Open/closed state transitions
- **Retry Attempts**: Number of retry operations

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Gradual Scale-Up
- Start with 1 node, 1 ENI
- Gradually add nodes and ENIs
- Monitor performance degradation points
- Target: 10 nodes × 10 ENIs

### Scenario 2: Burst Creation
- Create all 100 NodeENI resources simultaneously
- Measure time to completion
- Monitor resource contention

### Scenario 3: Mixed Operations
- Simultaneous create, update, and delete operations
- Simulate real-world workload patterns
- Test controller stability under mixed load

### Scenario 4: Failure Recovery
- Introduce AWS API failures
- Test circuit breaker behavior
- Validate recovery mechanisms

### Scenario 5: Scale-Down Performance
- Delete all NodeENI resources
- Measure cleanup time and efficiency
- Validate proper resource cleanup

## Test Environment Setup

### Simulated Environment (Recommended)
- Use mock AWS clients for initial testing
- Kubernetes cluster with simulated nodes
- Controlled environment for reproducible results

### Real AWS Environment
- EKS cluster with actual EC2 instances
- Real AWS API interactions
- Production-like testing conditions

## Performance Thresholds

### Acceptable Performance Targets
- **ENI Creation**: < 30 seconds per ENI
- **ENI Attachment**: < 15 seconds per attachment
- **Reconciliation**: < 5 minutes for full cluster
- **Controller CPU**: < 200m under normal load
- **Controller Memory**: < 256Mi under normal load
- **Error Rate**: < 1% for normal operations

### Warning Thresholds
- **ENI Creation**: > 45 seconds
- **Controller CPU**: > 300m
- **Controller Memory**: > 384Mi
- **Error Rate**: > 2%

### Critical Thresholds
- **ENI Creation**: > 60 seconds
- **Controller CPU**: > 400m
- **Controller Memory**: > 512Mi
- **Error Rate**: > 5%

## Configuration Optimizations

### Recommended Settings for Scale Testing
```yaml
controller:
  maxConcurrentReconciles: 15      # Increased from default 5
  maxConcurrentENICleanup: 8       # Increased from default 3

resources:
  controller:
    limits:
      cpu: 1000m                   # Increased from 500m
      memory: 1Gi                  # Increased from 512Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 200m                    # Increased from 100m
      memory: 256Mi                # Increased from 128Mi

metrics:
  enabled: true                    # Enable for monitoring
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Prometheus Metrics to Monitor
- `eni_operations_total`
- `eni_operation_duration_seconds`
- `aws_api_calls_total`
- `aws_api_call_duration_seconds`
- `circuit_breaker_state`
- `coordination_conflicts_total`
