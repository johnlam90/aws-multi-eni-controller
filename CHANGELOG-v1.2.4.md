# AWS Multi-ENI Controller v1.2.4

## Code Quality Improvements
- Refactored `verifyENIAttachments` method to reduce cyclomatic complexity
- Improved code maintainability by breaking down complex functions into smaller, more focused ones
- Enhanced error handling for ENI attachment verification
- Fixed code quality issues identified by gocyclo

## Technical Changes
- Split `verifyENIAttachments` into multiple helper methods:
  - `verifyAndUpdateAttachment`: Verifies a single ENI attachment and updates it if needed
  - `isAttachmentValid`: Checks if the attachment ID is still valid
  - `isENIProperlyAttached`: Checks if the ENI exists and is properly attached to the correct instance
  - `handleENIDescribeError`: Handles errors from DescribeENI
  - `updateAttachmentInfo`: Updates the attachment information (subnet CIDR, timestamp)
  - `updateNodeENIStatus`: Updates the NodeENI status with the verified attachments
- Improved error handling and logging
- Maintained all functionality while improving code structure

## Compatibility
- No breaking changes
- No changes to the API or behavior
- Fully compatible with previous versions
